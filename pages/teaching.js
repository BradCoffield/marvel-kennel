          At Rocky Mountain College, Ashley teaches a wide range of creative
          writing courses across genres and levels, from Introduction to
          Creative Writing and Introductory Poetry Workshop to Advanced Fiction
          Writing and Senior Capstone. As an instructor, she seeks to encourage
          her students’ intellectual curiosity and willingness to take risks and
          to create a space where all members of the classroom community feel
          supported as they engage in the process of making meaning and
          discovering their voices. Her students have published work from her
          courses in <em>Montana Quarterly</em>, <em>Allegheny Review</em>,{" "}
          <em>Pithead Chapel</em>, and numerous other venues.

          In addition to her work at the college level, Ashley has considerable
          experience teaching in non-traditional settings. In 2016 she
          co-founded a creative writing group for student veterans and service
          members at Duquesne University, the DU Dog Tags Literary Society, and
          in 2017, she received grants from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts
          for writing groups she initiated at a local vet center and public
          library. Beyond this, she has worked with at-risk youth in a group
          home setting and taught fiction and poetry writing in a summer camp
          for middle and high school students.
