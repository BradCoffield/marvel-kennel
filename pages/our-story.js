          Our kennel was birthed from a super-hero theme within our home, me
          (Rebecca), my three sons (Zach, Preston, and Julian), and my
          almost-daughter-in-law, Hana.
        </p>

        <p>(I'm thinking a pic of everyone here would be good)</p>

        <p>
          Zach, the oldest of three, is a disabled young adult. Our love for
          Newfoundlands started almost 20 years ago with Balu, when Zach was a
          toddler. We became hooked on this gentle, giant breed. Newfies are
          truly nannies (think Peter Pan), and after Balu passed, we knew we’d
          need another Newfoundland. Sadie became our second and has watched
          over our family for four years now, nothing less than tender love born
          from something both ancestral and maternal.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we bought Sadie, I was uncertain if we would breed her. This
          year, Zach completed the 18-21 program here in Idaho, and we found few
          job options for a young adult with disabilities to explore. Most
          programs for disabled adults seeking independence revolve around
          job-shadowing that includes shelf-stocking or store greetings. Zach
          has always wanted more than that. I've always wanted him to stretch as
          far as he can.
        </p>

        <p>
          We decided Marvel Kennels would be a great launch for a guy like Zach.
          He’s compassionate and a nurturer and a lover of all things furry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zach’s endured over 36 procedures (including heart, eyes, feet, and
          more) and, in many ways, he’s our family (and friends’) super-hero.
          He’s an overcomer and through all his hospitalizations and surgeries,
          he’s held a great attitude.
        </p>
        <p>And...</p>
        <p>
          So has his two brothers, Preston and Julian. They too, are
          super-heroes, showing up for the challenges in a family with a single
          mom and an older brother with Williams Syndrome. It has not been an
          easy gig, but they have each brought joy and heart and stars to the
          table. Every single day.
        </p>
        <p>
          It made sense that our kennel would revolve around a superhero theme.
        </p>
        <p>Here we are. MARVEL KENNELS.</p>
        <p>
          Because life is a marvel and we don’t take the precious days we have
          together lightly. <br /> Because birth is a marvel. <br /> Because
          family is a marvel. <br /> And of course, this breed, in our opinion,
          the best breed in all the land.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sadie's first pregnancy included a natural breeding with another AKC
          registered Newfoundland, Bruno. (We don't talk about Bruno).
        </p>
        <p>
          We acquired the responsible certifications and tests for Sadie to
          ensure that we would have the healthiest puppies possible. Sadie is
          certified through the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for her
          heart, hips, elbows, dental, and knees. She also has her Penn-Hip.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re a quiet family in the quiet town of Star, Idaho. We raised our
          dogs with a lot of family love and group hugs, so they are accustomed
          to children and other family pets (including a cat).
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal with Marvel Kennels is to share the joy that Newfoundlands
          have brought and continue to bring to our own family. We are part of a
          nonprofit organization (501c3)(Life’s Little Solutions) and we do
          accept donations.
        </p>

        <p>
          For this litter, we have donated two puppies to those in need who will
          benefit greatly from the gift of a Newfoundland. We plan to continue
          giving forward in the future.
